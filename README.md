# FrDisCos (French Discourse Connectives)This repository contains a list of French discourse connectives created using the approach described in [(Laali, M and Kosseim, L. 2014)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C/C14/C14-1058.pdf).This list constructed after applying the Syntax Tree filter. This filter is more accurate than the other filters described in the paper. The format of the file is as follow:PDTBsRelation<>SyntaxLabel FrDiscourseConnective<>Rank LLR CooccurrenceFreq SyntaxLabelFreq CuePhrasesFreqPDTBsRelation: The PDTBâ€™s relation assigned to the cue phrase.SyntaxLabel: The label of the node in syntax parse tree which covers all the cue phrase.FrDiscourseConnective: The literal of cue phrases.Rank: The rank of the cue phrase in the list.LLR: Log likelihood ratio score between the tuple <SyntaxLabel CuePhrase> and PDTBsRelation.CoOccuranceFreq,  SyntaxLabelFreq, CuePhrasesFreq: Frequencies extracted from our corpus that need to calculate log likelihood ratio.The first line can be ignored as this line is total number of discourse relations in our corpus.
